# PROJECT NAME

Weekend React Gallery

## Description

_Duration: 3 Days_

For our week 8 weekend challenge, we were given the task to develop a to-do list to collect user inputs and send them to a server and database. The database should keep the history of user inputs. The server will also send back to the client the history of to-dos. The database will update its state and the client will render it to the DOM. Users will have the ability to toggle to-dos as complete and delete them.

## Usage

1. Enter an image path and description into the input fields and submit. Description may be omitted.
2. A list of images will be displayed below.
3. Users may like and delete images.

## Built With

Visual Studio Code, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Express, Postgres, and React
